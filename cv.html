			<div class="cv-content">
				<p>An experienced, professional developer with 5 years working in the web industry. Coding is my passion, and I have a great appreciation for beautiful, functional UI/UX and everything frontend. I have top-level experience in hand coding valid semantic HTML5 from designs, modularizing SCSS and working hand in hand with UX experts in several projects and environments. A performance geek, I love optimising to squeeze out the last millisecond ensuring quicker rendering and load times. I thrive on finding new ways of speeding up workflow and improving architecture, often attending talks to learn the latest tech.</p>
				<p>Incredibly passionate and driven about my work, I possess great communication skills, considering the views of others whilst articulating my own professional opinion. Effective independently or as part of a team, managing where necessary and working under pressure. I love to produce clean, semantic, accessible solutions and am looking for an opportunity to work with a team of experienced professionals with whom I can develop my skills.</p>
